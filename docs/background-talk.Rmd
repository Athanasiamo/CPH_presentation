Has anyone here played the puzzle game "Portal"? 
It's a really challenging game of puzzles you need to solve, you are set in a type of experiment and you are told at the end of almost every level or puzzle that you just need to finish all the puzzles and then there will be cake.
So you start off with low levels, thinking this isn't too hard, you'll soon get cake. 
Like science during Uni start, just follow the steps, you will make science.
So you start doing your research, and slowly you start realising there are many hurdles.
It's a little trickier that the books claim, there are issues people did not discuss with you.
But you keep going, there will be cake.

Well, it's not a complete lie.
But the world is much more complex than the text books seem to tell us. 
And research on humans is very tricky, you cannot control them like you do cell cultures or mice.
Humans live their lives, and you are lucky if they participate in your study.
So you take anyone wanting to join, and have to make some constrains to your design.

What are the key consepts we want out of Lifespan research, what are the general questions people want answered?
But, a search on Pubmed for _human lifespan_ gave me 45993 results, but they mostly seem to discuss the expansion of human life, not the study of human lifespan differences per se. 
Searching for _Lifespan trajectory_ gave me only 856 results, many of which are animal studies.

# Lifespan studies on humans

- [LCBC studies](https://www.oslobrains.no/)  

- [Betula - Aging, memory, and dementia](https://www.umu.se/en/research/projects/betula---aging-memory-and-dementia/)  

- [HCP lifespan](https://www.humanconnectome.org/lifespan-studies)  

- [Dallas Lifespan Brain Study](http://lodismith.canisiuspsychology.net/studies/dlbs/)  

- [Southwest University Adult Lifespan Dataset](http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/retro/sald.html)  

- [The Rhineland study](https://www.neurodegenerationresearch.eu/it/cohort/the-rhineland-study/)  


???
So lifespan studies on human, atleast using those words, are not too common, but are becoming increasingly so.
It difficult with lifespan samples, because the tests we use to study young children, and older adults are very different, and mapping the same constructs at different ages is quite challenging. 
To my knowledge, only three of these studies again are longitudinal or prospective.

The popularity of using mixed models is increasing.
Here we see how the number of pubmed papers with linear mixed models increases yearly in psychological research, and this trend I'm pretty sure extends also to other fields.
While mixed models as a consept is not new, the increasing power of computer and development of available tools is making it possible for more and more people to apply these methods to their data. 
So we will look more into using mixed models in lifespan research, and the benefits of that.

# Lifespan research

##  - using cohorts - 


???
I'll begin walking through doing lifespan research using age cohorts.
Something that is very often done, because that is the most convenient way of studying it.
However, cohort studies have some _real_ limitations we need to think about, and they constrain the questions we are able to answer.

---

# Lifespan research - using cohorts

```{r "cohorts-anim"}
knitr::include_graphics("anims/cohort.gif")
```


???

If you begin with two samples, you get a nice straight line. The connection looks simple.
Then, if you start adding more and more data, filling in the gaps in age, you will start to see that the nice straight line is not so nice and straigt, and the variance between different age cohorts also varies.
This is not the simple relationship you thought of. 

---

# Lifespan research - using cohorts

```{r "cohort-3"}
j <- sim_data[sim_data$Age_group %in% c("(0,10]", "(30,40]", "(80,90]"),]

jm <- j %>% 
  group_by(Age_group) %>% 
  group_means(Age, Hippocampus)

j %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=Age, y=Hippocampus))  +
  geom_point(alpha=.2, size=.5, colour="grey40") + 
  geom_errorbar(data=jm, inherit.aes = FALSE, 
                aes(x=Age_Mean, width=4,
                    ymin = Hippocampus_Mean - Hippocampus_SE,
                    ymax = Hippocampus_Mean + Hippocampus_SE)) +
  geom_point(data=jm, inherit.aes = FALSE, 
             aes(x=Age_Mean, y = Hippocampus_Mean, 
                 colour=Age_group)) +
  geom_line(data=jm, inherit.aes = FALSE, 
             aes(x=Age_Mean, y = Hippocampus_Mean)) +
  scale_colour_lifebrain()
```

???
Furthermore, what is the difference between these two cohorts? Is it just their age? Can we say that the difference between these two groups is due to age-related changes, or is it tangled together with the generational effects. They are born in completely different times, health care, education, and societal differences are all intertwined in there. 

---

# Lifespan research - using cohorts

```{r "cohort-age-groups"}
sim_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=Age, y=Hippocampus)) +
  geom_point(alpha=.4) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", aes(group = group, colour = group, fill=group)) +
  scale_colour_lifebrain(aesthetics = c("colour", "fill"))
```

???

In many cases, when people have large samples like this, they'll split them up by age-groups, perhaps using breakpoints in the data.
Here I did a rough grouping based on visual inspection only.
And there is nothing wrong per se in splitting data up like this, I do this myself when intepretations of my models start being difficult due to directions in young and old age being opposite.

## Number of cohorts
### Two or three age cohorts are not enough to elucidate lifespan trajectories  
### Given enough cohorts, we can cover the lifespan and reveal plausible trajectories

So there are some limitations with cohorts.
In fact, the power needed to find results is much higher in cohort studies as compared to longitudinal studies, as I will exemplify from a published study from out center later.

# Lifespan research

##  - longitudinal linear models - 


???
For now, I want to zoom in a bit on the adulthood group.
I choose this because a linear model is not a bad fit for this data.

---

# Lifespan research - longitudinal linear models 
```{r "long-lm"}
adults <- sim_data[sim_data$group == "Adulthood", ]

adults %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=Age, y=Hippocampus)) +
  geom_point(alpha=.6) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", aes(group = group, colour = group)) +
    scale_colour_lifebrain(aesthetics = c("colour", "fill"))
```


???

You can tell by the data that there is some curvature to the data, but its not so much that a linear model will go very wrong.
But I was asked to come and talk about lognitudinal data, not cohorts.
So I've covered cohorts to show-case better what logitudinal studies bring to the table; the ability to actually say something about how people change, not only that there are differences between people of different ages. 
In this linear model, we are treating every data point as independent, as they are coming from different people. 
Which in many studies is true, but not for this data. 

---

# Lifespan research - longitudinal linear models 
```{r "long-lm2"}
adults %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=Age, y=Hippocampus)) +
  geom_point(alpha=.6) +
  geom_line(aes(group=ID), alpha=.6) +
  scale_colour_lifebrain(aesthetics = c("colour", "fill"))
```

???

Here, I have connected the datapoints originating from the same persion with lines.
Notice how there are longitudinal participants across the entire lifespan, and that there is some order here. 
We have longitudinal data, people are sampled at different ages, with different time intervals, and varying observational timepoints. 
We are breaking all the rules for running simpler models like repeated measures anovas, who particularly depend on data being sampled uniformly.
Longitudinal lifespan data usually does not have this tidy feature. People are difficult to sample, and controlling time intervals and people skipping measurement times becomes increasingly difficult the longer the study goes on. 
And you want the studies to keep on going as long as possible, and for each new observation from a participant, that participant becomes increasingly important to the study.


???
We saw in the original plots, that there clearly was more to this relationship than a simple 
linear solution.
When data is clearly non-linear, and you cannot improve fit with polynomials (quadratic, cubic etc.), then a smoothing spline is what you are after.
Smoothing splines are very neat, and often by default fine pretty good solutions.

```{r "lmm-fit"}

    ) %>%

              aes(ymin=fit-se, ymax=fit+se, group=method, fill=method)) +
  geom_line(data = fit_data, aes(y=fit, group=method, colour=method), size=1) +
  scale_colour_lifebrain(aesthetics = c("colour", "fill"))
```

???

Here, we see the regression lines from two different models.
One is the standard linear model, treating each observation as independent, and another having been informed that some of the observations actually are not independent.
The change in the line is slight, and you might not think much of it. Indeed, the change is not huge here.
In the practical talk, I will also cover briefly how you can check which model is best suited for your data, and how you can check if your models are violating base assumptions of the tests you are using.
The main point here, is that you cannot use a normal linear model on repeated data, because it violates the key assumption of the observations being independent.
Once you have multiple observations per person, you need to adopt an analysis strategy that accounts for this. 
Some may argue you could calculate the slope per person, and then use this in a model. Yes, you can, but you loose so much data!
You loose all those who only have a single data point, and those with more than two, you need to decide which two to take, or the average change, and at which age? 
It forces you to really reduce the data a lot, when what you have is so rich, and ideal for other types of models, you should be utilizing those.

???

When looking at the entire dataset, the model fit here is not really linear, it has a smooth shape. 
A curve that we should be accounting for in some way.
This is quite common in lifespan research. Usually, there is a type of curve, and the curve is not cubic or quadratic or any type of polynomial.
Those kinds of curves you can fit using a linear model, though that might sound counter intuitive. Polynomials are variations on the linear model, so it is not too difficult to alter the fit. 

But this data, is rather a complex type of smoothed spline. It alters its curve in a way that cannot be easily solved with variations of linear models, and requires other types of solutions.
But as before, the normal generalized additive models require independent observations. 
This curve show us spline if the data were independent.
We know they are not.

# Lifespan research - longitudinal smoothing spline

```{r "gam-vs-gamm"}
m1 <- gam(Hippocampus ~ s(Age), data = sim_data)
mm1 <- gamm(Hippocampus ~ s(Age), 
            data = sim_data, random = list(ID = ~1))

fit_data <- sim_data %>% 
  mutate(
    gam_fit = predict(m1, new.data = tibble(Age = seq(0,100, by=1)), se.fit = TRUE)[[1]],
    gam_se = predict(m1, new.data = tibble(Age = seq(0,100, by=1)), se.fit = TRUE)[[2]],
    gamm_fit = predict(mm1$gam, new.data = tibble(Age = seq(0,100, by=1)), se.fit = TRUE)[[1]],
    gamm_se = predict(mm1$gam, new.data = tibble(Age = seq(0,100, by=1)), se.fit = TRUE)[[2]]
    ) %>% 
  gather(key, val, contains("gam")) %>% 
  separate(key, c("method", "stat")) %>% 
  spread(stat, val)

sim_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=Age, y=Hippocampus), colour="lightgrey") +
  geom_point(alpha=.4) +
  geom_line(aes(group = ID), alpha=.4) +
  geom_ribbon(data = fit_data, alpha=.3,
              aes(ymin=fit-se, ymax=fit+se, group=method, fill=method)) +
  geom_line(data = fit_data, aes(y=fit, group=method, colour=method), size=1) +
  scale_colour_lifebrain(aesthetics = c("colour", "fill"))
```

???
So when we look at the prediction, the fit, of the model using the information about observations belonging together, the curve changes.
The change might not seem large here, but it makes a difference, and the line parsimoniously also _looks_ like it fits the data better.
We no longer have that weird tail going upwards, and there is less waves in the curve, and the curve at the end has a more smooth transition. 
The gam makes it look like a type of tipping point around age 60, when people have an accelerated decline, and in fact, a lot of research out there is showing just that.
But here we can see, that when we incorporate longitudinal data aspects, that tipping point is not so tipping, its a more gradual change. 
And also, we can see that people are not ending up in the same place. 
People doing well at earliuer ages have a similar change trajectory as those with lower scores, but there is an offset diffference.

**Objectives**
Establish how the relationship between sleep and hippocampal volume loss unfolds across the adult lifespan.

**Methods**
Self-reported sleep measures and MRI-derived hippocampal volumes were obtained from 3105 cognitively normal participants (18–90 years). Hippocampal volume change was estimated from longitudinal MRIs, followed up to 11 years with a mean interval of 3.3 years.

Annual percent change in volume as a function of sleep. Tested at four different ages, annual reduction in hippocampal volume was on average 0.22% greater in participants scoring two compared to zero on the PSQI items quality, efficiency, problems, and daytime tiredness. Error bars denote 95% CI.

**Results**
However, worse sleep quality, efficiency, problems, and daytime tiredness were related to greater hippocampal volume loss over time, with high scorers showing 0.22% greater annual loss than low scorers. The relationship between sleep and hippocampal atrophy did not vary across age. 

**Conclusions**
Worse self-reported sleep is associated with higher rates of hippocampal volume decline across the adult lifespan.

The human cerebral cortex is highly regionalized, and this feature emerges from morphometric gradients in the cerebral vesicles during embryonic development. We tested if this principle of regionalization could be traced from the embryonic development to the human life span. Data-driven fuzzy clustering was used to identify regions of coordinated longitudinal development of cortical surface area (SA) and thickness (CT) (n = 301, 4–12 years).

This means that regions that developed together in childhood also changed together throughout life, demonstrating continuity in regionalization of cortical changes. The AP divide in SA development also characterized genetic patterning obtained in an adult twin sample. In conclusion, the development of cortical regionalization is a continuous process from the embryonic stage throughout life.

Changes in cortical thickness occur throughout the lifespan, but the neurobiological substrates are poorly understood. Here, we compared the regional patterns of cortical thinning (>4000 observations) with those of gene expression for several neuronal and non-neuronal cell types (Allen Human Brain Atlas). Inter-regional profiles of less thinning and greater gene expression several marker genes during development. The same expression – thinning patterns – were mirrored in aging, but in the opposite direction.

The aim of the present study was to test whether there are unique developmental changes in recall memory performance using extended retention intervals, and whether these are related to structural maturation of sub-regions of the hippocampus. 650 children and adolescents from 4.1 to 24.8 years were assessed in total 962 times (mean interval ≈ 1.8 years). The California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT) and the Rey Complex Figure Test (CFT) were used. Recall was tested 30 min and ca. 10 days after encoding. 

**Fig. 2.** Developmental trajectories for memory.
Development of CVLT (left column) and CFT (right column) recall performance. The plots in the bottom row show how performance in the 10 days retention interval recall condition improves when recall performance on the 30 min retention interval condition is accounted for.

Structural maturation of hippocampal sub-regions. Top row shows microstructure (mean diffusion), bottom row shows volume.
 
We found unique developmental effects on recall in the extended retention interval condition independently of 30 min recall performance. For CVLT, major improvements happened between 10 and 15 years.

**Memory and hippocampal subfields**

The heat plot illustrates the statistical significance (uncorrected p-value) of the relationship between hippocampal structure (volume and mean diffusion) and memory performance. 
The relationships did not show anterior-posterior hippocampal axis differences. In conclusion, performance on recall tests using extended retention intervals shows unique development, likely due to changes in encoding depth or efficacy, or improvements of long-term consolidation processes.

Prosocial behavior, or voluntary actions that intentionally benefit others, relate to desirable developmental outcomes such as peer acceptance, while lack of prosocial behavior has been associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders. Mapping the biological foundations of prosociality may thus aid our understanding of both normal and abnormal development, yet how prosociality relates to cortical development is largely unknown. Here, relations between prosociality, as measured by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (self-report), and changes in thickness across the cortical mantle were examined using mixed-effects models. The sample consisted of 169 healthy individuals (92 females) aged 12–26 with repeated MRI from up to 3 time points, at approximately 3-year intervals (301 scans). 

- Prosociality relates to cortical development from early adolescence to adulthood

- Higher prosociality relates to greater cortical thinning in early adolescence  
- This is followed by attenuation of this pattern during the transition to adulthood  

Fig. 3. Cortical maturation for individuals with high and low prosociality. Individuals were classified as high prosocial if they consistently rated themselves as high on prosociality throughout the study, and as low prosocial if they consistently rated themselves as low. The plot shows mean cortical thickness from the clusters where interactions between prosociality and age2 were significant. Note that the low/high division was made for illustration purposes only, while the statistical analyses were run with prosocial behavior as a continuous measure.

Fig. 4. Contour plots of relations between prosocial behavior, age and cortical thickness. The plots indicate that the relations between prosociality and CT were positive for the youngest and the oldest group across all the identified significant clusters. Such a relationship was not present in the middle of the age range (late adolescence). Each plot contains mean cortical thickness from the clusters where interactions between prosociality and age2 were significant. The green to white color scale indicates low to high cortical thickness values.

- Associations are observed in regions involved in social cognition and behavioral control
